## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/main/main.png)
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FErruar%2FSaku-Overclock.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FErruar%2FSaku-Overclock?ref=badge_shield)

Saku Overclock is an incredible utility for Ryzen laptop overclocking, providing precise control over various parameters to enhance your device's performance. Our program offers:

* Accurate Current Tuning: Manage VRM, SoC, processor, and integrated graphics currents, giving you complete control.
* Temperature Management: Set the maximum temperature for all laptop components, excluding the discrete GPU. This helps prevent overheating and makes your laptop more efficient. When temperatures exceed the set threshold, processor frequencies can automatically decrease to maintain optimal conditions.
* Frequency and Voltage Configuration: Set frequencies for processor performance states and their corresponding voltages to achieve optimal efficiency.
* Fan Control: Regulate fan speed, adjust its curve, and save configurations for quick access. Create custom presets for convenience.
* Settings Persistence and Sharing: All your settings are automatically saved, and you can export/import them, facilitating sharing with other users.
* Real-time Monitoring: Keep track of processor metrics, temperature, GPU, RAM, battery, and more in real-time.
* Resource-Optimized Operation: Thanks to optimization, the application runs smoothly and quickly without burdening unnecessary processor resources.
* Background Operation and Auto-Start: The program can operate in the background or automatically start with the system, ensuring user convenience.

With Saku Overclock, you gain full control over your laptop, optimizing its performance and maintaining optimal temperature conditions.
Of course, you can copy my program in your projects! So I'll be adding more in the near future. Thanks for using it!

    <h1 align="center">CPU Overclocking</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_cpu_1.png"></img>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_cpu_2.png"></img>
    <p  >â€¢ CPU Overclocking: Allows users to adjust the power and temperature of their CPU, which can significantly increase performance.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">VRM Tuning</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_vrm_1.png"></img>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_vrm_2.png"></img>
    <p  >â€¢ VRM Tuning: Allows users to adjust VRM settings, Currents and timings of your CPU. Note: Super dangerous settings are CPU voltage relative and available ONLY on Raven (2000), Dali (3000) and Picasso (3000) CPUs otherwise you shouldn't see those options. I actually don't recommend you to try those options.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">iGPU and CPU subsystem clocks</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_sub_1.png"></img>

    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_sub_3.png"></img>
    <p  >â€¢ iGPU and CPU subsystem clocks: Allows users to overclock clocks iGPU and other CPU subsystems. Note that this section works and visible only on processors Ryzen Raven Ridge (2000), Ryzen Dali (3000), Zen Athlon (3000) and Ryzen Picasso (3000) line, and changing these parameters DOES NOT GIVE a 100% chance that the frequency will always be equal to what you set. This will affect their base frequency, from which the main frequency is generated. In simple words, these frequencies are influenced by a lot of factors (temperature, load, power), which is why it is very difficult to make sure that the frequency is always the same. Also, I do not give any guarantees that these parameters will be unlocked for you, in case of an error you will see in the notification which parameters were not applied. About "Fix Ryzen 0,4 GHz frequency" or fix Ryzen 0,39 GHz frequency: this really can fix Ryzen 0,4 GHz issue, but it actually works also only for Ryzen Raven Ridge (2000), Ryzen Dali (3000), Zen Athlon (3000) and Ryzen Picasso (3000) CPU lines. "Max performance" will give your CPU the maximum RAM State - 2400 MHz for CPU and 1000 MHz for iGPU. We CAN NOT adjust it. And one note: fan speed can be MAXIMUM and there is NO WAY to fix it only if you have working for your laptop Notebook Fan Controller configuration. On other Ryzen CPU lines AMD have removed AcBtc state and there is no way to fix this issues on non 2000-3000 CPUs. But I've trying to found a solution! Thank you, testers!</p>

    <h1 align="center">Advanced CPU parameters</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_adv_1.png"></img>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_adv_2.png"></img> 
    <p  >â€¢ Advanced CPU parameters: Allows users to adjust more advanced CPU parameters, which are intended for experienced overclockers and can be risky if not configured correctly. Note: Some BIOS can Reject those options! Don't worry if nothing happens.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">CPU Power States</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_pst_1.png"></img>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_pst_2.png"></img> 
    <p  >â€¢ CPU Power States: Allows users to adjust the power states of the CPU, even with system starts (if my app in autostart). everything is the same here as with the frequency of the iGPU and CPU subsystems - "and changing these parameters DOES NOT GIVE a 100% chance that the frequency will always be equal to what you set" because the frequency and voltages of your processor depends on so many factors, which is why it is extremely problematic to set a specific frequency and voltages and make your processor keep it. However, this way you bring your processor closer to the specified values. Note: on some laptops NEEDED to activate OC1 mode in OC MODE in BIOS "AMD CBS/Zen common options" and disable CPB.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">All cores curve optimizer settings</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_co.png"></img>  
    <p  >â€¢ All cores curve optimizer settings: Allows users to adjust voltage/frequency curve of the CPU or iGPU with custom coefficient from user, even with system starts (if my app in autostart). Those settings gave you maximum control of your CPU voltage.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
   <h1 align="center">Per core curve optimizer settings</h1>

    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_co_ccd_3.png"></img>  
    <p  >â€¢ Per core curve optimizer settings: Allows users to adjust voltage/frequency curve of each CPU core with custom coefficient from user, even with system starts (if my app in autostart). Those settings gave you maximum control of your CPU voltage. This setting is above than "All cores curve optimizer" and "iGPU curve optimizer" settings. You have 3 different modes: Disabled - this section and all those settings are disabled (same if checkbox near this mode selector is unchecked), Saku Laptops - method for almost all Ryzen Laptops, Saku Desktop - method for almost all Ryzen Desktop CPUs *not all Desktop CPUs my app supports, Irusanov method - method for almost all CPUs most universal if others are not work properly. After changing those settings please CHECK stability and voltages! There are safe limits but also check!</p>

    <p  >â€¢ Per core curve optimizer settings+: same with usual "Per core curve optimizer settings" section but for 8+ cores CPUs</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">SMU Parameters editor</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_smu_1.png"></img>
    <p  >When you open SMU section - enable "Apply SMU commands" to apply them! Autodetect is there, pls DON'T CHANGE RSP, ARG and CMD Addresses! If you know SMU commands for your CPU, you can type them as a hint into Quick note box. You can highlight them if it needed or paste photo there. Autosaving is there. Note: due to the various limitations of various laptop manufacturers, basically even if you know the SMU commands for your processor, there are no guarantees that all commands will work, and there is also no documentation on their use, so I recommend using them in extreme overclocking or only at the request of someone who really understands this topic! These parameters may well irretrievably burn your processor without leaving it a chance. Please note that if the command is blocked, it cannot be unblocked. If the command is "Not found", it is still possible to unlock it, but no one knows how, sometimes completely different actions help. Please note that the first status after application is the status of the Saku Overclock parameters, and the second message with the status of the SMU parameters!</p>
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">Quick SMU commands</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_smu_2.png"></img>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_smu_4.png"></img>
    <p  >â€¢ SMU Parameters editor and Quick SMU commands: Allows users to edit  SMU parameters for extreme overclocking, and is likely best left to experienced overclockers only. These commands can do ANYTHING with your CPU even BURN IT!!! BE CAREFUL! If you know your CPU commands, you can add them in Quick SMU Commands and apply them by pressing their buttons, by pressing Apply button or with app start (even with autostart with system!). You can give any name, description and icon for your quick command. It's very practical! For example, you need to quickly change the voltage to the desired value or return the frequency to normal or raise the PBO - you just click on the apply button on the desired command and your processor immediately applies this effect! Again, the commands are NOT freely available, and you will have to search for them yourself. Please note that the commands are in HEX format!!! To quickly convert from decimal to HEX, highlight your value or just right-click on the Arguments field and select Convert to HEX. Note that you do NOT need to write 0x in the command. The commands usually look like 0x2E, 0x11, this is just an EXAMPLE. You don't need to write 0x. if the command accepts multiple arguments, separate them with "," (like: 17, 19, 20, 80). It can give you best experience of your laptop if you KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING. This is not a joke and your processor may well burn out from ignorance of commands. You can customize your Quick SMU commands, apply them with app start or with apply button and reapply every second automatically</p>
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">Apply range to SMU command</h1>
    <img alt="Picture" src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/params_smu_3.png"></img> 
    <p  >â€¢ Apply range to SMU command: You can apply range to one SMU command. It's useful for unlocking all SMU features at once or in some other variants.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 align="center">SMU functions manager</h1>

### Built With

My program was built using Win UI 3 .NET 9.0 interface with UWP framework and is based on C#. Application uses custom version of **RyzenAdj**, created by me only for Saku Overclock for viewing information on information page. RyzenAdj is written on C++ programming language. Also program contains **Zen States Core**, **inpoutx64**, **winring0** and **Collapse launcher** elements.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Let's figure out how to install my app!
To get a copy of my app and running follow these simple steps:

### Requirements

In order for my app to work properly, you will first need to download Notebook fan controller
[Link to download](https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/releases)
If you don't want to control the coolers through my app, you can skip this step.

### Installation

Let's install my app! It's easier than you think

1. Get a `.exe file` from releases: [Releases link](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/releases)
2. Double-click on downloaded `.exe`
3. Install it as usual application
4. Open Saku Overclock link from your Desktop
5. Welcome to overclock world!

### If you have any troubles

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Using my program is pretty simple! Go to the premaded profiles page tab and apply the desired one. 
Or if you have a special case (for example, 0.4 GHz issue) or you want to get the most out of your laptop, then the Overclock page is for you. 
On it, you can set the values that you want, and if you don't know what to do, there are tips and recommendations for balance and performance

If you have found the perfect settings for yourself, just click on the apply button at the bottom right, it looks like a Play Music icon. But before that, I **RECOMMEND** going to the settings page and making sure that you have enabled "Reapply latest settings every (S)", after which, applying your settings, they will be updated every time, depending on what time you set, because some laptop manufacturers add a Power Limits self-healing protocol to the BIOS so that the laptop does not burn down in case of something. 

### About burning
My program **will not** cause your processor to overheat if you **avoid** the following:
- Setting the maximum temperature **above 90 degrees**,
- Setting **very high Power Limits** while simultaneously setting **very low Time** for fast and slow frequency increases,
- Using own SMU parameters **without proper understanding**, manuals, warnings, or by accident,
- Creating an NBFC configuration file to control the cooler speed, as this **may stop the fan**. Be cautious! Only create such configurations when the Fan Service Control Status is set to Disabled or Read Only,
- **Increasing the frequency beyond the maximum**. I do not guarantee the safety of such actions. All potentially dangerous parameters are marked with a special icon; hover over it and **read** what changes before making any adjustments.

> Please **install** my program, it's not difficult and take some **your screenshots** of my program. Rate app work and write a review. Your feedback. Instead of copying the Readme completely, write something from yourself or rephrase it, I won't mind seeing something like this, for example, it was done on [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/Saku-Overclock.shtml#download) and on [Top4Downloads](https://www.top4download.com/saku-overclock/tuykfucn.html). And don't forget to specify me as the author of the program! Just links to the program are not enough, you need to specify me as the author, I am trying for you alone and I hope that you understand if I wrote this, then there have already been cases. It would be great if you also provided a link to our [discord community](https://discord.gg/WzgsFvgTuh). Thanks for understanding.
