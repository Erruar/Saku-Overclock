## 🔨 Built With

Saku Overclock is built using **C#**, utilizing **WinUI 3** and the **Windows App SDK** to provide a modern, native Windows experience.

### Core Components & Libraries

*   **ZenStates-Core**: Powering the backend, this C# library handles communication with the System Management Unit (SMU) to access hidden optimization settings.
*   **Saku RTSS CLI**: A custom C++ bridge that manages the In-Game Overlay, displaying real-time sensor data and FPS.
*   **NBFC (Notebook Fan Control)**: The engine responsible for managing fan speeds and custom cooling curves.
*   **PawnIO**: A low-level driver ensuring universal hardware access for applying overclocking settings safely.
*   **inpoutx64**: Essential library for direct memory access operations.
*   **Collapse Launcher**: UI/UX components adapted to enhance the visual interface and user experience.
<br/>

## ⚡ Get Started in Seconds

Saku Overclock works immediately after installation. You do not need technical expertise to use the application.

1.  **Download** the installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/releases).
2.  **Install** the application.
3.  **Launch** Saku Overclock.
    *   *During the first launch, a setup screen will help you personalize the experience.*
4.  **Choose a preset** on the main dashboard (for example, "Maximum" or "Eco") and click the ▶ **Apply**.
5.  **The system is now optimized.**

> **Note:** The application may ask to install the **PawnIO driver** on the first launch. This driver is safe and required for the application to communicate with the hardware. Please allow the installation.


## ✨ Tailored to Your Needs

Saku Overclock adapts to your requirements, whether you need a quick result or full control.

### Quick Start
After the setup, the main dashboard displays real-time system monitoring and a list of presets. Select a preset and apply the settings to improve performance immediately. You do not need to configure anything else.

### Advanced Tuning
If you want to customize the settings, Saku Overclock offers advanced tools:
*   **Presets Management:** View and edit profiles using simple visual sliders. This page helps you understand the effect of each preset.
*   **Overclock Page:** Adjust specific power, thermal, current limits and processor behavior.
    *   **Safety Limits:** The application restricts values to safe ranges to prevent hardware damage.
    *   **Smart Suggestions:** The system analyzes your hardware and suggests stable values.

### Automation
Once you find the best configuration, go to **Settings**. Enable **Startup with OS** and **Auto-apply latest settings**. The application will automatically optimize your device every time the system boots.


## 🛡️ Stability & Safety Guide

We prioritize the safety of your hardware. Follow these rules to ensure a stable experience.

### Incremental Tuning
When you create custom presets, do not maximize values immediately.
1.  Increase a value slightly (for example, add **+5W** to the power limit).
2.  Apply the setting.
3.  Test the system stability under load.
4.  If the system is stable, you can increase the value again.

### Notification Center
After you apply a preset, check the **Notification Center** in the application.
*   The notification confirms settings are applied.
*   If a setting was **not applied**, the notification will explain the reason.
*   The notification may provide a link to the FAQ or suggest disabling the incompatible option.

### Recovery from System Freeze
If you set values that are too high, the device may freeze or shut down. **This is normal during the tuning process.**

1.  **Force Shutdown:** Hold the power button on your device for 5–10 seconds until the screen turns off.
2.  **Turn On:** Power on the device.
3.  **Try Again:** By default, Saku Overclock **does not apply settings on boot after crash**. Your device will start with factory settings. You can open the application, lower the values in your preset, and try again.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Vision

We are currently in a critical phase: **The V1.0 Release**. Our primary focus is ensuring rock-solid stability for the core features.

Once the release settles, development will be driven by community feedback and polls. However, we already have some game-changing technologies on the horizon:

### Coming Soon
- [ ] **OC Finder Next**: The next evolution of our tuning algorithm. It won't just suggest settings; it will actively run stress tests and iteratively refine parameters to find the absolute peak performance for your specific silicon.
- [ ] **Stream Stabilizer**: A dynamic resource maneuvering engine. It adjusts CPU properties in real-time to ensure rock-solid frame times during streaming or heavy multitasking.
- [ ] **Advanced Thermal Management**: Full control over fan curves, including "Smart Curves" that adapt to your workflow.
- [ ] **Preset Automation**: Automatic preset switching based on power source (Battery vs. AC Adapter).

### Global Reach
- [x] English Support
- [ ] Community-contributed translations (Coming post-release)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
