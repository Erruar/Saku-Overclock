## 🔨 Built With

The program was developed using the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) framework and WinUI 3 interface based on the **C# programming language**.

### ❓ What other components does Saku Overclock include?
 - **ZenStates-Core (C#)**: Provides access to all hidden overclocking options through memory addresses and system management unit (SMU). 
 - **Ryzenadj (C++)**: Custom version to display information about device sensors.
 - **Saku RTSS CLI (C++)**: Library that helps to change the in-game overlay to display information about your device's sensors and FPS.
 - **NBFC (C#)**: Executable to adjust cooler curves and speeds.
 - **Collapse Launcher elements (C#)**: Some code elements to improve UI/UX.
 - **inpoutx64.dll (C++)**: Library to obtain access to memory.
 - **winring0.dll (C++)**: Library for writing CPU specific MSRs.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## ⏩ Getting Started

Ready to unlock your laptop's true potential? Saku Overclock installs in minutes and starts delivering results immediately.

### Prerequisites

**Enhanced Fan Control (Optional)**  
For advanced cooling management, install [Notebook Fan Controller](https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/releases) before proceeding. This enables custom fan curves and thermal profiles.  
*Skip this step if you prefer automatic thermal management.*

### ⚡ Quick Installation

Experience professional overclocking in three simple steps:

1. **Download** the latest release from our [releases page](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/releases)
2. **Run** the installer and follow the standard Windows installation process  
3. **Launch** Saku Overclock from your desktop and begin optimizing

That's it. Your laptop is now ready for precision tuning.

### 🛠️ Need Assistance?

Encountering installation issues? Our community is here to help.  
[**Report an issue →**](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/issues/new)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## 🧠 Easy setup. Advanced features. Maximum performance.

Saku Overclock provides a user-friendly experience for users. Navigate to the “Presets management” page and choose the one that best meets your needs, whether it's reducing temperature, improving performance, or addressing specific issues such as the 0.4GHz problem on AMD Ryzen processors.

Wishing to extract the full potential from your laptop? Access the “Overclock” page, where you can manually adjust the desired settings. If you are unsure where to start, the software offers intelligent suggestions and guidance to help you achieve optimal settings and maximum performance.

After finding the ideal settings, click the “Apply” button in the **lower right corner**, which looks like a **music playback icon**. Saku Overclock will then decide how and what adjustments to make. You can experiment with parameters or contact our Discord community for assistance if needed.

Some laptop manufacturers have implemented an automatic power recovery mechanism in their firmware to address factory power limitations or specific operating modes. However, Saku Overclock prevents this by automatically reverting values set in the program, without placing additional stress on the system.

### 🔥 Reliability and Temperature Issues:

**Saku Overclock will not cause overheating** if certain risks are avoided. These include:
- Setting maximum temperature limits above 90 degrees Celsius.
- Simultaneously setting excessive power limits and using short time intervals for them.
- Creating custom NBFC configurations to control fans, especially if the fan service is set to disabled or read-only mode especially **without proper knowledge**, as this may **stop the fan** operation. Be cautious.
- Using obscure or random SMU commands in developer mode without proper understanding or warning.
- Increasing the frequency or voltage **beyond the acceptable processor limits** is not guaranteed to be stable and may be dangerous.

### 🆘 Something went wrong after applying the settings

If your laptop starts to behave abnormally or you experience freezes, blue screens, or a complete shutdown after applying overclock settings, please change the settings. Saku Overclock strives to provide a safe overclocking experience, and all settings are tested on real hardware before being released. If your laptop freezes or the screen goes blank, press and hold the power button for 5-10 seconds until it turns off. Then, you can reboot your laptop normally. Overclock settings will not function after reboot if you have not enabled autorun for Saku Overclock.
If you experience any issues with the program, please do not hesitate to contact us.

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FErruar%2FSaku-Overclock.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FErruar%2FSaku-Overclock?ref=badge_shield)

This project is distributed under the terms of the **GPL-3.0** license. For more information, see the file [`LICENSE.md `](./LICENSE.md ).

The application also contains **individual code elements** from the [Collapse Launcher project](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Collapse), distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Collapse/blob/main/LICENSE).
All borrowed code fragments are properly **marked** as belonging to Collapse Launcher, and in accordance with the terms of the MIT license contain **the full text of the license**, as well as an indication of authorship and a link to the original source.


## 🔒 Legal & Licensing

For my part, I'll mention a few important points about publishing my app on third-party resources.:

### 🎭 Copyright Policy

You **have the right to distribute** builds of my application on third-party resources and platforms. However:

* You can copy the source code of a project only as the license GPL-v3-only allows.
* Copying the README **in full** or without modification to your website — **is not permitted without my consent**.

If you want to share the program on a third-party site, please **be sure to include me as the author** of the project in the description. Just posting a link to the application **is not enough** — I have done a lot of work to create this tool, and I count on your respect for my work.

### ☀️ How do I properly place this app on my website?

The most correct way is to **install the app**, test it and create **your own screenshots**. You can write a **review** with your personal opinion about the functionality, convenience or features of the work. This is much better than mindlessly copying the Readme text.

So, for example, they correctly applied to [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/Saku-Overclock.shtml#download) and [Top4Downloads](https://www.top4download.com/saku-overclock/tuykfucn.html), for which I am sincerely grateful to them.

When publishing, do not forget:

* **Specify me as the author of the program** (Serzhik Sakurajima / Erruar),
* Add a link to [our Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/eFcP6TSjEZ) — this will help new users to adapt faster.

Thanks for understanding. I'm trying to make this tool better, including for you.
