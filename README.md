## 🔨 Built With

Saku Overclock is built using **C#**, utilizing **WinUI 3** and the **Windows App SDK** to provide a modern, native Windows experience.

### Core Components & Libraries

*   **ZenStates-Core**: Powering the backend, this C# library handles communication with the System Management Unit (SMU) to access hidden optimization settings.
*   **Saku RTSS CLI**: A custom C++ bridge that manages the In-Game Overlay, displaying real-time sensor data and FPS.
*   **NBFC (Notebook Fan Control)**: The engine responsible for managing fan speeds and custom cooling curves.
*   **PawnIO**: A low-level driver ensuring universal hardware access for applying overclocking settings safely.
*   **inpoutx64**: Essential library for direct memory access operations.
*   **Collapse Launcher**: UI/UX components adapted to enhance the visual interface and user experience.
<br/>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## ⚡ Getting Started

Get up and running in minutes. Saku Overclock is designed to be plug-and-play, handling the complex setup for you.

1. **Download** the latest installer from our [releases page](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/releases).
2. **Install** the app by running the setup file (standard Windows installation).
3. **Launch** Saku Overclock.
4. **Done!** You are ready to start optimizing.
> **Note:** On the first launch, the app might ask to install the **PawnIO driver**. Please allow this — it is a safe, required component that lets the app communicate with your laptop's hardware.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## ✨ Unlock Your Performance

Saku Overclock is designed to adapt to your expertise level. Whether you want a one-click boost or granular control, we've got you covered.

### 1. Choose Your Mode
*   **For Beginners (Presets):**  
    Navigate to the **Presets Management** page. Select a pre-configured preset to instantly cool down your device, boost FPS, or fix specific CPU throttling issues (like the Ryzen 0.4GHz bug).
*   **For Enthusiasts (Manual Tuning):**  
    Head to the **Overclock** page. Tweak power limits, curves, and specific sensor values.
    > **Tip:** Unsure about a setting? Saku offers intelligent suggestions to guide you toward stable values.

### 2. Apply & Monitor
Once you've configured your settings, click the **Play Button** (▶) in the bottom right corner.
*   **Smart Management:** Saku actively monitors the system to ensure your settings stick, bypassing aggressive manufacturer power limits without stressing the hardware.
*   **Safety Notifications:** Pay attention to warning notifications in the app notification center. There you can see which options were not applied.


### 🛡️ Safety & Recovery Guide

We prioritize the safety of your hardware. Saku Overclock includes built-in limits, but responsible usage is key.

**Best Practices:**
*   Avoid setting temperature limits above **90°C**.
*   Do not disable fans (via NBFC) unless you know exactly what you are doing.
*   Increase values incrementally.

**Emergency Recovery (Read This):**
If you push the system too far and experience a freeze or black screen:
1.  **Don't Panic.** This is a normal part of the tuning process.
2.  **Force Shutdown:** Hold the Power button for 5-10 seconds until the laptop turns off.
3.  **Reboot:** Turn the laptop back on.
    *   *By default, Saku does not auto-apply settings on boot.* Your system will start with safe, stock settings, allowing you to try again.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Vision

We are currently in a critical phase: **The V1.0 Release**. Our primary focus is ensuring rock-solid stability for the core features.

Once the release settles, development will be driven by community feedback and polls. However, we already have some game-changing technologies on the horizon:

### Coming Soon
- [ ] **OC Finder Next**: The next evolution of our tuning algorithm. It won't just suggest settings; it will actively run stress tests and iteratively refine parameters to find the absolute peak performance for your specific silicon.
- [ ] **Stream Stabilizer**: A dynamic resource maneuvering engine. It adjusts CPU properties in real-time to ensure rock-solid frame times during streaming or heavy multitasking.
- [ ] **Advanced Thermal Management**: Full control over fan curves, including "Smart Curves" that adapt to your workflow.
- [ ] **Preset Automation**: Automatic preset switching based on power source (Battery vs. AC Adapter).

### Global Reach
- [x] English Support
- [ ] Community-contributed translations (Coming post-release)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
