<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/main.png)

Saku Overclock is an incredible utility for Ryzen laptop overclocking, providing precise control over various parameters to enhance your device's performance. Our program offers:

* Accurate Current Tuning: Manage VRM, SoC, processor, and integrated graphics currents, giving you complete control.
* Temperature Management: Set the maximum temperature for all laptop components, excluding the discrete GPU. This helps prevent overheating and makes your laptop more efficient. When temperatures exceed the set threshold, processor frequencies can automatically decrease to maintain optimal conditions.
* Frequency and Voltage Configuration: Set frequencies for processor performance states and their corresponding voltages to achieve optimal efficiency.
* Fan Control: Regulate fan speed, adjust its curve, and save configurations for quick access. Create custom presets for convenience.
* Settings Persistence and Sharing: All your settings are automatically saved, and you can export/import them, facilitating sharing with other users.
* Real-time Monitoring: Keep track of processor metrics, temperature, GPU, RAM, battery, and more in real-time.
* Resource-Optimized Operation: Thanks to optimization, the application runs smoothly and quickly without burdening unnecessary processor resources.
* Background Operation and Auto-Start: The program can operate in the background or automatically start with the system, ensuring user convenience.

With Saku Overclock, you gain full control over your laptop, optimizing its performance and maintaining optimal temperature conditions.
Of course, you can copy my program in your projects! So I'll be adding more in the near future. Thanks for using it!

    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/main.png"></img>
    <p align="left"> Here you can see the contents of the Parameters page. This page is the most important in the entire application, as it allows you to configure overclocking the way you need it.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/1.png"></img>
    <p align="left">• CPU Overclocking: Allows users to adjust the power and temperature of their CPU, which can increase performance.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/2.png"></img>
    <p align="left">• VRM Tuning: Allows users to adjust VRM settings, Currents and timings of your CPU.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/3.png"></img>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/4.png"></img>
    <p align="left">• iGPU and CPU subsystem clocks: Allows users to overclock clocks iGPU and other CPU subsystems. Note that this section works and visible only on processors Ryzen Raven Ridge (2000), Ryzen Dali (3000), Zen Athlon (3000) and Ryzen Picasso (3000) line, and changing these parameters DOES NOT GIVE a 100% chance that the frequency will always be equal to what you set. This will affect their base frequency, from which the main frequency is generated. In simple words, these frequencies are influenced by a lot of factors (temperature, load, power), which is why it is very difficult to make sure that the frequency is always the same. Also, I do not give any guarantees that these parameters will be unlocked for you, in case of an error you will see in the notification which parameters were not applied.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/5.png"></img>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/6.png"></img>
    <p> </p>
    <p align="left">• Advanced CPU parameters: Allows users to adjust more advanced CPU parameters, which are intended for experienced overclockers and can be risky if not configured correctly. It will works only on Ryzen Renoir (4000) and above processors!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/7.png"></img>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/8.png"></img>
    <p> </p>
    <p align="left">• CPU Power States: Allows users to adjust the power states of the CPU, even with system starts (if my app in autostart). everything is the same here as with the frequency of the iGPU and CPU subsystems. There is far from a 100% chance that the frequency will always be the same as you set here or the voltage, however, this way you bring your processor closer to the specified values</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/9.png"></img>
    <p align="left">When you open SMU section - enable Quick commands to apply thems! Autodetect is there, pls DON'T CHANGE RSP, ARG and CMD Adresses! If you know SMU commands for your CPU, you can type them as a hint into Quick note box. You can highlight them if it needed or paste photo there. Autosaving is there</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/10.png"></img>
    <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/custom/11.png"></img>
    <p align="left">• SMU Parameters editor: Allows users to edit  SMU parameters for extreme overclocking, and is likely best left to experienced overclockers only. These commands can do ANYTHING with your CPU even BURN IT!!! BE CAREFUL! If you know your CPU commands, you can add thems in Quick SMU Commands and apply them by pressing their buttons, by pressing Apply button or with app start (even with autostart with system!). You can give any name, description and icon for your quick command. It's very practical! For example, you need to quickly change the voltage to the desired value or return the frequency to normal or raise the PBO - you just click on the apply button on the desired command and your processor immediately applies this effect! Again, the commands are NOT freely available and you will have to search for them yourself. Please note that the commands are in HEX format!!! To quickly convert from decimal to HEX, highlight your value or just right-click on the Arguments field and select Convert to HEX. Note that you do NOT need to write 0x in the command. The commands usually look like 0x2E, 0x11, this is just an EXAMPLE. You don't need to write 0x. if the command accepts multiple arguments, separate them with "," (like: 17, 19, 20, 80). It can give you best experience of your laptop if you KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING. This is not a joke and your processor may well burn out from ignorance of commands</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Let's figure out how to install my app!
To get a copy of my app and running follow these simple steps:

### Requirements

In order for my app to work properly, you will first need to download Notebook fan controller
[Link to download](https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/releases)

### Installation

Let's install my app!

1. Get a `certificate.pfx` from releases: [Releases link](https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/releases)
2. Double click on certificate then click next, don`t use any passwords, press next, then IMPORTANT: choose "Place all certificates in the following store" (second) and click "browse", then choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" (second), click "OK" and "Next", then "Finish" and "Ok"
   <details>
     <summary>Installation in pictures:</summary>

       <img src="https://github.com/Erruar/Saku-Overclock/blob/master/Images/install/5.png"></img>
     </ol>
   </details>
3. Install `.appx` like normal `.exe` or `.msi` file
4. Open app via Windows -> All apps
5. Now you have installed my app!

### If you have troubles with certificate
How to install app without certificate:
1. <a href="https://github.com/colinkiama/EasyCertInstall/releases"><strong>Download EasyCertInstall</strong></a>
2. Put `EasyCertInstall.exe` into folder with my `.appx` app
3. Run `EasyCertInstall.exe` as Administrator and wait for message from it
4. Run my app from Windows button or from Windows Search and you can delete `EasyCertInstall.exe` and `.appx`!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Using my program is pretty simple! Go to the presets tab and apply the desired one. 
Or if you have a special case (for example, 0.4 GHz issue) or you want to get the most out of your laptop, then the Parameters tab is for you. 
On it, you can set the values that you want, and if you don't know what to do, there are tips for balance and performance

If you have found the perfect settings for yourself, just click on the apply button at the bottom right, it looks like a Play Music icon. But before that, I RECOMMEND going to the settings page and making sure that you have enabled "Reapply latest settings every", after which, applying your settings, they will be updated every time, depending on what time you set
